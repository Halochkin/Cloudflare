# cloudflare-tutorial / [typing racer app](https://github-proxy.maksgalochkin2.workers.dev/test/index.html)


 Simple example application for developing fast typing skills. After logging in with Google or Github, you can save your previous speed typing sessions to compete against them. The repository also contains useful information and examples of how to use the Cloudflare worker

The main task of the application is to be used to test the cloudflare worker functionality as well: 
- KV (key-value) cloudflare store
- AES-GCM encryption/decryption
- http requests and their headers
- CORS requests
- Cookies
- Custom web components
- Proxy server
- Google/Github authentication
- Test of custom state manager (Similar to Redux, but better=))
