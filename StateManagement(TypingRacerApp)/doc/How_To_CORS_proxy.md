# HowTo: CORS proxy

A cross-origin request is a request for website resources external to the origin. For example, `a.example.com` tries to serve resources from `b.secondexample.com`. The CORS instructs the browser to determine if a cross-origin request (e.g., an image or JavaScript from `b.seconddexample.com`) is allowed by `a.example.com`. The browser does not load resources that are forbidden by CORS.

The `Access-Control-Allow-Origin` header allows servers to specify rules for sharing their resources with external domains. When a server receives a request to access a resource, it responds with a value for the Access-Control-Allow-Origin header.

As you may have noticed, we always add a response header named `Access-Control-Allow-Origin` to the static response. The Access-Control-Allow-Origin response header indicates whether the response can be shared with requesting code from the given origin. CORS headers designed to protect sources from access by other sites. If we try to run our application directly on the client (browser side), the browser will apply CORS policies to the domains you are trying to test and block those requests. 

Limiting the possible `Access-Control-Allow-Origin` values to a set of allowed origins requires code on the server side to check the value of the Origin request header, compare that to a list of allowed origins, and then if the Origin value is in the list, to set the Access-Control-Allow-Origin value to the same value as the Origin value.

A response that tells the browser to allow requesting code from the origin `https://proxy.max.workers.dev` to access a resource.

When use Fetch API to get data, it is necessary to use `Content-Type` header. The `Content-Type` header is used to indicate the media type of the resource. The media type is a string sent along with the file indicating the format of the file. For example, for image file its media type will be like image/png or image/jpg, etc.
 
In response, it tells about the type of returned content, to the client. The browser gets to know about the type of content it has to load on the machine. Every time its byte stream of the file that browsers receive, by the Content-type header, the browser will do something known as MIME sniffing i.e. it will inspect the stream it is receiving and then loads the data accordingly.


## Examples

Let's look at an example in which there are two workers. The first (**proxy-worker**) makes a request to github and returns the file. The second one (**kv-worker**) returns data from _KV_ using url path.

 > It is important to note that the first worker cannot make a direct request to the second one on server side. Working with multiple workers is only possible on the client side (in the browser). This is why we use two Workers. That is, the first worker cannot query the second one to retrieve data from the KV directly. 

So the **proxy-worker** returns a script which makes these requests. This means that it doesn't request **kv-worker** on the server side, it does it from the browser. 


Now let's figure out which _HTTP header_ we are going to use.

1. **proxy-worker**
 Since **proxy-worker** makes a request to github and returns a string with code, it is necessary to use a `Content-Type` header with a MIME type match to the extension of the requested file ("text/html" for example).

2. **kv-worker**
Here it is necessary to use both `Content-Type` and `Access-Control-Allow-Origin` headers. 

   * Since the `script` element obtained with **proxy-worker** runs on the client side, it still uses the proxy-worker URL (_https://proxy.maksgalochkin2.workers.dev/inline-script.html_) and all requests will be made from that URL. 
    Therefore, **kv-worker** should be allowed to respond to such requests by defining the _proxy-worker url_ as the value of the `Access-Control-Allow-Origin` header 
  ```
     const header =  {"Access-Control-Allow-Origin": "https://proxy.maksgalochkin2.workers.dev/inline-script.html"} 
  ```

   * Since KV stores data in _JSON_ format you need to define their MIME type using the `Content-Type` header. 

 > MIME type is better to define with extension of requested file

   ```javascript
      const type = path.substr(path.lastIndexOf('.') + 1);
```

### Demo1

1. **Proxy-worker**

```javascript
const link = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Halochkin/Cloudflare/master/StateManagement(TypingRacerApp)/demo/";
let contentType;

async function makeFetch(path) {
    return await fetch(link + path)
        .then(response => response.text())
        .then(data => data)
        .catch(error => console.error(error))
}

async function handleRequest(request) {
    try {
        const url = new URL(request.url);
        const path = url.pathname;
        const type = path.substr(path.lastIndexOf('.') + 1);
        if(type === "/")
         return new Response("My Error: File extension not defined");
     
        if (type === 'js')
          contentType = 'application/javascript' ;
        else
          contentType =  'text/' + type;

        let res = await makeFetch(path);
        return new Response(res, { status: 200, headers: { "Content-Type": contentType} });
    } catch (e) {
        return "404 Not found"
    }
}

addEventListener("fetch", e => {
    e.respondWith(handleRequest(e.request))
});
```

2. Open `https://proxy.max.workers.dev/script.js` url in your browser to fetch html file with script element inside. 
 
```html
 <html>
  <script>
   (async function(){
     document.body.innerText = await fetch("https://kv.max.workers.dev/data.json").then(response=> response.json()).then(data=> data);
   })();
  </script>
 </html>
 ```
3. Self invoking function will do fetch request to `kv-worker`.

**KV-worker**

```javascript
async function handleRequest(request) {
  let headers = { "Access-Control-Allow-Origin": "https://proxy.maksgalochkin2.workers.dev" };
  const url = new URL(request.url);
  const path = url.pathname;
  const [ignore, key] = path.split('/');
  const type = path.substr(path.lastIndexOf('.') + 1);
  let contentType;

  if (type === "svg")
    contentType = 'image/svg+xml'
  else
    contentType = 'application/' + type

  if (!key)
    return new Response("no action", { header: headers });

  if (request.method !== 'GET')
    return new Response('Not GET request');

  const value = await KV_STORE.get(key);
  if (value === null)
    return new Response("Value not found", { status: 404 });
  return new Response(value, { headers: { ...headers, 'content-type': contentType } });
}

addEventListener("fetch", e => {
  e.respondWith(handleRequest(e.request));
});
```
### Demo2
1. Open `https://proxy.maksgalochkin2.workers.dev/index.html` url to fetch image which use kv data as a src attribute value.
```html
<html><img src="https://kv.maksgalochkin2.workers.dev/img.svg"></html>
```
Instead of self invoking function, src attribute will produce fetch event which will make request into KV and return svg element as response. HTTP headers are the same as in previous demo.
